## Background Context:beginner:

* **Web static, what?**
  After designing a command interpreter for managing Airbnb objects, it's time to bring them to life!

Before developing a big and complex web application, the frontend will be built step-by-step.

The first step is to "design," "sketch," or "prototype" each element:
  - Create simple HTML static pages.
  - Establish a style guide.
  - Use fake contents.
  - Avoid using JavaScript.
  - Do not load data from any external sources.
* **INTRODUCTION**
The project covered a variety of topics related to web development and HTML, including the definition and purpose of HTML, how to create an HTML page, and an understanding of markup languages. It also explained the DOM (Document Object Model), the concept of elements or tags, and attributes in HTML. Additionally, the project delved into how a browser loads a webpage and the role of CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) in web design. It provided insights into adding styles to HTML elements, the significance of classes, and the usage of selectors for styling. Furthermore, the project covered the computation of CSS Specificity Value and explored box properties in CSS. In summary, the project provided a comprehensive overview of HTML, CSS, and related concepts crucial for web development.
